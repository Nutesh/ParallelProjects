Given N points on the cartesian plane.  We need to find the minimum number of steps required to traverse all points (from start to end) in the same order as given.  From a point, movement in all 8 directions are possible and every movement is counted as a step.

Input : 
The first line of input contains number of test cases T. For every test case, the first line contains the number of points N and the second line contains the sequence of points represented by 2*N numbers.

Note : Points are given in the following order : x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 ….. and so on)

Output : 
For each test case, Print the minimum number of steps required to reach end point from starting point by traversing the sequence in order.

Constraints : 
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= Value of coordinates (x,y) <= 1018

Example :
Input :
2
3
0 0 1 1 1 2
4
1 0 1 2 6 3 6 4
Output :
2  
8

Explanation : 
For test case 1 :
The starting point is (0,0) and the ending point is (1,2). Now, (1,1) can be reached from (0,0) in 1 step and (1,2) can be reached from (1,1) in 1 step, therefore the answer becomes 2.

For test case 2 :
The starting point is (1,0) and the ending point is (6,4). Now, (1,2) can be reached from (1,0) in 2 steps, (6,3) can be reached from (1,2) in 5 steps and (6,4) can be reached from (6,3) in 1 step, therefore the answer becomes 8.








You are given an array of size N. An operation can be done in which the value of an element can be decremented to >=1. You need to find the maximum sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements after performing as many operations as required, that is, maximum sum of absolute differences between all the pairs of adjacent elements.

Input: The first line contains testcases T. In each testacase, the first line contains N number of array elements, the second line contains array elements.

Output: Print the maximum sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= A[i] <= 106

Example:
Input:
2
4
4 5 7 10
4
2 9 10 3

Output:
17
19

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Reduce array 4 5 7 10 to 1 5 1 10. The maximum sum of absolute differences is:
                    | 1- 5 | = 4 + | 5 - 1 | = 4 + | 1 - 10 | = 9 => 17
Testcase 2: Reduce array 2 9 10 3 to 2 1 10 1. The maximum sum of absolute differences is:
                    | 2- 1 | = 1 + | 1 - 10 | = 9 + | 10 - 1 | = 9 => 19
